Beginning with the Spring 2010 report, 
     GfK MRI will release the net estimate in order to represent the magazine's total audience.
$ OK! was measured as OK! Weekly in Waves 63 and 64.
% As of February, 2009, Parenting was rebranded as two separate magazines: Parenting Early Years and Parenting School Years.  Since GfK MRI measures the common logo of these two magazines, 
     the resulting Parenting's audience estimate represents a net of the two.
